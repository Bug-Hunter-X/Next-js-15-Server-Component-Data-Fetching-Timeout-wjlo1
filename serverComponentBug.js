In Next.js 15, an uncommon issue arises when using server components with a complex data fetching structure.  If you have nested `async` calls or deeply recursive functions within your server component, and these functions trigger additional data fetches, it's possible to exceed the default request timeout or encounter unexpected behavior from Next.js's internal data fetching mechanisms.  This can lead to silent failures or incomplete data being returned to the client.  For example, a seemingly infinite loop in the data fetching process can crash the server or prevent a response.
